Task Completion Summary
Task 1: UI/UX Redesign
Directory: Python Screening Task 1 UIUX Enhancement.zip  

Objective: Improve the user experience and interface of a workshop booking system.

Major Enhancements:

Implementation of mobile-first responsive design

Contemporary visual navigation and hierarchy

Enhanced instructor and coordinator user flow

Increased accessibility and cross-device support

Professional looks appropriate for educational settings

Note : For implementaion of task 1 check: task1_implementaion.md 

Task 2: AI Debugging Assistant Prompt Design
File: Python Screening Task 2.pdf

Objective: Design an efficient AI prompt for educational code debugging and analysis assistance.

Major Design Principles:

Tutor Persona: Presented as a professional Python programming tutor

Constructive Guidance: Identifies problems but does not give straight solutions

Error Categorization: Solved syntax errors, logical errors, and inefficiencies

Pedagogical Approach: Promotes self-discovery and conceptual grasp

Supportive Tone: Uses positive, supportive tone throughout

Task 3: Assessing Open Source Models for Student Competence Analysis
File: Python Screening Task 3.pdf

Objective: Study and analyze open-source AI models applicable for educational competence analysis in Python programming.

Research Methodology:

Model Identification: Code-specific models (e.g., Code Llama) through Hugging Face and GitHub

Evaluation Criteria: Code comprehension quality, prompt generation effectiveness, and computational efficiency

Testing Framework: Realistic student error scenarios with expert validation

Trade-off Analysis: Accuracy vs. interpretability vs. computational cost

Technical Implementation (Task 1)
The workshop booking system redesign consists of:

Backend: Django 3.0.7 (Python web framework)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5

Database: SQLite (development)

Authentication: Django's built-in authentication system

Design Approach: Mobile-first responsive design

Key Findings of Research Tasks
Task 2: Design Philosophy for Prompts
Uses Socratic questioning methodologies to promote self-revelation

Supports technical correctness in conjunction with learnability

Discriminates feedback according to error type (syntax, logic, efficiency)

Supports encouraging tone to enhance student confidence

Task 3: Findings on Model Evaluation
Appropriate Models: Code-specific models such as Code Llama offer best trade-off of capability and accessibility

Critical Capability: Conceptual comprehension in excess of syntax checking

Ideal Approach: Smaller open-source models provide improved interpretability and affordability for educational environments

Validation Method: Expert review of generated prompts with clear evaluation criteria

Design Philosophy
The overall approach across the three tasks focuses on:

Pedagogical Effectiveness: Prioritizing authentic learning over fixes

Accessibility: Solutions applicable across varying resource contexts

Practical Implementation: Balance between theoretical optimum and practical realities

Student-Centered Design: Focus on learner experience and building confidence

Compliance Notes
All submitted work is original work completed for this application process

The UI/UX redesign preserves all the original functionality with very much enhanced user experience

Deliverables for tasks conform to the format requirements as set out in the internship guidelines

Evaluation methods utilize rigorous, scholarly-sound methods
